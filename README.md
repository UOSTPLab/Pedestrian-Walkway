# Pedestrian-Walkway

The codebase consists of five components:

1. RandomCropping
2. Rotation
3. Fixed and non-fixed obstacle detection
4. VOC2YOLO
5. YOLO2VOC

For data augmentation reflecting weather conditions, we used the GitHub repository (https://github.com/UjjwalSaxena/Automold--Road-Augmentation-Library).

Explanations for each code component are provided in the comments.
